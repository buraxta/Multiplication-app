# Multiplication App

This is a study aiming for making some practice with HTML-CSS-JavaScript.  
With this app, we generates 2 numbers in the background and asks the user for the result of their multiplication. And we give points according to the answer.
  In this tutorial we learned basically;  
- How to use autofocus and autocomplete features in HTML
- How to use box-shadow, border-radius, box-sizing, display: block property, cursor: pointer, ::hover ..etc in CSS
- How to store data user entered in the localStorage, JSON.stringify and JSON.parse properties, adding eventListener.. etc in JavaScript
